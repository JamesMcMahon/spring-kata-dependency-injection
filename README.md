# Spring Dependency Injection Katas

These Katas are a series of exercises to learn more about Dependency Injection and how Spring handles it. 
Each exercise is self-contained and contains a failing test that you will need to get passing.

*This repo is still heavily work in progress.*

## How to interact with the exercises

1. Run the test suite. You should see all the tests fail initially.
2. In order, go through each exercise and see if you can make the test pass.

Each exercise has a Javadoc comment that will give you context. 

Remember, don't change the tests - *that's cheating!* Make each test pass by changing only implementation code.
